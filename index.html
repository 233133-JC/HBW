    <h1> Welcome to Hot Beans Web!</h1>
    <p>
  <br><br>
  Hot Beans Web was founded in 2010 by Philip Heinz due to his passion for web development.
  He  couldn't find anything that would allow him to create a website, so he thought he could do it better and decided to start a company.
  The name Hot Beans Web comes from Philip's middle name, "Heinz".
  In 2013, Philip finally moved his business from a small office in Chobham to a larger office on Farnborough Industrial Estate, which enabled Philip to expand his business and increase the number of clients.
  As of 2019, Hot Beans Web works with multiple companies to provide you with the best experience possible.
